        <center><h1><a name="faq"></a>FAQ</h1></center>
<b>How much is it going to cost me to participate?</b><br>
It will be £5 per person. Money will be collected upon registration on Friday.<br>
<br>
<b>Do we work individually or in teams?</b>
<br>You’ll be working in small teams (3-5 people) that will be allocated on place. We'll soon send you a short questionaire to fill if you would like to participate in a predefined team of people. </br>
<br>
<b>How are you going to allocate me in a team if I don't have one?</b>
<br>In the quiestionaire we'll send you, you'll need to fill where you are good at and we'll use this information to semi-randomly allocate you.</br>
<br>
<b>What is the schedule?</b><br>
Friday evening: challenges and team allocation. Go to sleep. Saturday morning -> Sunday morning: coding. We will give you more details on Friday evening.<br>
<br>
<b>What are the challenges?</b>
<br>Can't tell you! You'll get to know that on Friday. You and your team will then write your preferences (which one you would best like to work on, then second best etc.) and we'll allocate you to a challenge.</br>
<br>
<b>Can I start before the hackathon?</b><br>
As challenges will be announce on Friday evening, at any moment after that you can start planing, brainstorming or coding. However note, that the venue is not reserved for Friday-Saturday night, but if you want to work from home - that's fine with us.<br>
<br>
<b>Can I bring my own laptop?</b><br>
Yes. We encourage developers to bring their own devices. It is expected that you will demo your project directly on your computer. You can also bring phones, tablets, raspberry pies and teddy bears - whatever helps you.<br>
<br>
<b>What if I don’t finish the project in the allotted time period?</b><br>
You will be judged based on the completed features. It will be up to the judges’ discretion to determine how your project ranks against other teams’ projects.<br>
<br>
<b>Do I need to bring a sleeping bag?</b><br>
You can stay in the building for the night of Saturday-Sunday and if you want to take a nap you can take a sleeping bag with you. Notice however that for safety reasons around the building, participants will NOT be able to re-enter the Sir Alwyn Williams Building between 22:00 on Saturday and 8:00 on Sunday. A participant may leave during that time, but will not be able to re-enter the building until 8:00 on Sunday.<br>
<br>
<b>Tell me some more about the prizes.</b><br>
Prizes will be given to winners on the day or shortly after the hackathon. We'll give you more information on Friday evening.<br>
<br>
<b>What will you do with my information?</b><br>
We’ll only use your information for organising the hackathon and telling you about the event and the winners. We hate spam as much as you do so we’ll only contact you when we've got something interesting or important to tell you.<br>
<br>
<b>Media</b></br>
Please be aware that the media may decide to cover the hackathon and filming may take place during the hackathon. By participating in the hackathon, you agree to being filmed for promotional purposes and you also agree that information on the event and participants may be provided to the media.<br>
